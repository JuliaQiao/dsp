[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
-0.088672927072602

My output was negative, but Cohen's D is interpreted as an absolute number. this is much higher than 0.029 --the difference in pregnancy length. However, it's still low and doesn't look statistically significant.
